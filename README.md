# Project Title: Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction
Project Description: This project tackled the critical issue of high employee turnover by leveraging data analytics and machine learning to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and predict individuals at risk of leaving. Using tools like Streamlit, PySpark, Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Apache Airflow, I developed an end-to-end ETL pipeline that efficiently extracted, preprocessed, and loaded data from multiple sources. The pipeline also incorporated exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, followed by training a machine learning model to predict attrition. The best-performing model was deployed via Streamlit for real-time predictions, providing HR departments with an interactive interface. Apache Airflow was utilized to monitor and automate the pipeline, ensuring efficient, scheduled data processing and regular model updates.

Project Outcome: The deployed solution achieved an 80% accuracy rate in predicting employee attrition, empowering HR teams to proactively identify and address retention risks. This project contributed to improved employee satisfaction and reduced turnover rates by providing data-driven insights and supporting strategic retention initiatives. It demonstrates expertise in machine learning, data engineering, and deployment, with a strong emphasis on automation and operational efficiency.
